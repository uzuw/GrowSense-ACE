# GrowSense 🌿

An intelligent agriculture platform that helps farmers automate irrigation and make better farming decisions using real-time sensor data, AI-driven insights, and modern web technologies.

---

## Project Summary

GrowSense leverages IoT, cloud computing, and AI to provide farmers with an efficient, data-driven solution for smart farming. Using ESP32 microcontrollers and various sensors, the system collects environmental data (soil moisture, temperature, rainfall, etc.) and transmits it to a backend server. Farmers can securely monitor and control their devices via a user-friendly web interface.

Through integrated AI models and external APIs, GrowSense delivers valuable insights like optimal irrigation timings and crop rotation strategies, making agriculture more sustainable, efficient, and productive.

## 🌐 How It Works

1. **Data Collection:**  
   ESP32 sensors collect data on soil moisture, temperature, rainfall, etc.
   
2. **Data Transmission:**  
   Sensor data is sent to the backend server for processing.
   
3. **Data Analysis & Visualization:**  
   The backend processes data and presents it via the frontend dashboard built with Next.js & Chart.js.
   
4. **AI Recommendations:**  
   Integrated AI models (via OpenRouter API) provide actionable farming insights.
   
5. **Control System:**  
   Farmers can manage irrigation through auto, timer, or manual modes from their dashboards.
